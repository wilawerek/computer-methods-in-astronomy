%B A database of asteroid magnitude-phase relations compiled at the Institute of Astronomy of Kharkiv Kharazin University by Shevchenko et al., including observations from 1978 through 2008. Mainly the observations were performed at the Institute of Astronomy (Kharkiv, Ukraine) and at the Astrophysics Institute (Dushanbe, Tadjikistan).  For most asteroids the magnitude-phase relations were obtained down to phase angles less than 1 deg. For some asteroids the magnitudes are presented in three (UBV) or four (BVRI) standard spectral bands.
